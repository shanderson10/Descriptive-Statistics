# Performing a t-Test in Pyton:
#SciPy library is used to peform a t-test in Pyton.

import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Sample data
data = [102, 98, 100, 104, 99, 101, 97, 103]
# Population mean
population_mean = 100

# Perform one-simple t-test
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(data, population_mean)

print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat}, P-value: {p_value}")
T-statistic: 0.5773502691896258, P-value: 0.5817882345917442

# 2. Two-Sample t-Test (Independent):
#Comparing the means of two independent groups.
# Sample data from two independent groups
group1 = [20, 22, 23, 19, 24, 20]

T-statistic: -9.175266773341852, P-value: 3.4780789045783574e-06

# 3. Paired t-Test:
# Testing the same group before an after an intervention.
# Sample data before and after treatment
before = [200, 190, 210, 220, 205]
after = [195, 185, 205, 215, 200]

# Perform paired t-test

print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat}, P-value: {p_value}")
T-statistic: inf, P-value: 0.0
